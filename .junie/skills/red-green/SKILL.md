name: red-green
description: Implements a spec test-first in two phases. First failing tests for every acceptance criterion (RED), then a human review stop, then minimal code until everything is green without touching the tests. Use when implementing a feature that has a spec in docs/specs/, or when the user says "red-green", "test first" or "implement the spec".

# Red → green

Implement `docs/specs/<feature>.md` test-first. The tests are the verifier.
Once a human has approved them, do not change them.

## Phase 1: RED

1. Read the spec and the `AGENTS.md` files that apply. Read one existing
   test file next to the code you will change and copy its style (API
   tests: `server/src/app.test.ts`).
2. Write one test per acceptance criterion. Put the criterion in the test
   name (`AC1: …`) so a reviewer can map tests to the spec. Each test sets up
   its own state (its own `createApp()`): a test that only passes after
   another one ran is broken, and phase 2 may not fix it. New tests go in a
   new file next to the code: API `server/src/<feature>.test.ts`, app
   `<name>.<feature>.spec.ts` next to the component or store.
3. Run only the new tests: API `npm run test:server -- <feature>`, app
   `npm run test:app -- --include <path to the new spec>`. Every one
   must fail **for the right reason** (missing behaviour, e.g.
   `expected 'system' to be 'dark'`; a typo or an import error does not
   count).
   A criterion the code already meets may pass: keep it and say so.
4. **Stop.** Show the test names and the failure output. Ask the user to
   review the tests against the spec and commit them. Do not implement yet.

## Phase 2: GREEN

Only after the user approved and committed the tests:

1. Take the tasks from the spec's `## Tasks` section in order. For each task
   write the smallest change that turns its tests green. Follow existing
   patterns in the code (helpers, error shapes, state handling) instead of
   inventing new ones.
2. After each task run `npm run test:affected` and fix what you broke before
   moving on.
3. Tick the task in the spec (`- [x]`).
4. When all tasks are done, report: which criteria are covered by which
   tests, the output of a final `npm run check`, and anything you were unsure about.

## Rules

- **Never edit, delete, skip or weaken an existing test**, including the ones
  you wrote in phase 1. If you think a test is wrong, stop and say why.
- Never mark a task done without a green run you actually executed.
- No work beyond the spec. Non-goals stay non-goals.
