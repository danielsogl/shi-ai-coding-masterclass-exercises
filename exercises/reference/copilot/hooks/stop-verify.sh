# agentStop hook for GitHub Copilot (CLI + cloud agent): the closest
# equivalent to Claude Code's Stop hook. Runs typecheck + test:affected
# before letting the agent's turn end, same policy as the Claude Code
# stop-verify.sh next door (docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-reference,
# checked 2026-09).
#
# Decision is conveyed via stdout JSON, not exit code: `{"decision":
# "block", "reason": "..."}` forces another agent turn, using `reason` as
# the next prompt. This script always exits 0.
#
# Skips tests tagged BASELINE: (see e.g. apps/api/src/server.test.ts) —
# known, pre-existing, accepted-as-broken failures recorded once at the
# test name (see exercises/E6-real-world-constraints.md) — everything
# else, including the flaky test if it genuinely fails, still blocks.
#
# This script does not read the hook's JSON payload at all (it only needs
# $GITHUB_WORKSPACE / the repo root); malformed or missing stdin has no
# effect either way.
